# Predictive-Analysis-of-Crime-Incidence-in-Kenya-based-on-SocioEconomic-Factors
The aim of this project is to predict the number of different types of crime that will happen in Kenya in the near future. The data used is of Crime records that has been extracted from the Yearly Statistical Abstracts published by Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS). I cleaned the data sets and merged them to form a master data set that I used to train and test a Recurrent Neural Network model, which uses LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) Algorithm, best for time series data sets and making future predictions.
